# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Exploration

## 📌 Project Overview

***This project explores COVID-19 data using SQL to analyze different metrics such as infection rates, death rates, and vaccination progress. It leverages key SQL techniques, including:***

### - 🔗 Joins (to combine data from different tables)

📌 Common Table Expressions (CTEs) (for readability and reusability)

📂 Temporary Tables (to store intermediate results)

📊 Window Functions (for rolling calculations)

📈 Aggregate Functions (to compute totals and averages)

🔄 Data Type Conversion (to ensure proper calculations)

🖥️ Views (for efficient data retrieval in visualization tools like Tableau)

📑 Dataset

The data comes from two tables:

CovidDeath – Contains COVID-19 case and death statistics per country and date.

CovidVaccinations – Contains vaccination data per country and date.

🔍 SQL Analysis

1️⃣ Data Exploration

Retrieves all available data from CovidDeath where the continent field is not null to exclude aggregated global statistics.

2️⃣ Initial Data Selection

Extracts key columns such as location, date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, and population.

3️⃣ Total Cases vs Total Deaths

Calculates the death percentage per country to show the likelihood of dying after contracting COVID-19.

4️⃣ Total Cases vs Population

Determines the percentage of a country's population infected with COVID-19.

5️⃣ Countries with Highest Infection Rates

Identifies the countries with the highest total infection rates compared to their populations.

6️⃣ Countries with Highest Death Count per Population

Determines the total number of deaths per country, sorted in descending order.

7️⃣ Death Count Breakdown by Continent

Aggregates the highest death count per continent.

8️⃣ Global Statistics

Computes total new cases and deaths worldwide, along with the global death percentage.

9️⃣ Total Population vs Vaccinations

Uses window functions to calculate rolling vaccination numbers for each country.

🔟 Using CTEs for Vaccination Calculations

Creates a CTE (PopvsVac) to calculate the rolling number of vaccinated individuals per country.

1️⃣1️⃣ Using Temporary Tables for Vaccination Calculations

Implements a temporary table (#PercentPopulationVaccinated) to store vaccination data and compute the percentage of vaccinated individuals.

1️⃣2️⃣ Creating a View for Tableau Visualization

Defines a view (PercentPopulationVaccinated) to facilitate data access for visualization in Tableau.

📊 SQL Queries for Tableau Data Visualization

🌍 1. Global COVID-19 Impact

Calculates total cases, total deaths, and death percentage worldwide.

📍 2. Total Death Count per Location

Aggregates the total number of deaths per location while excluding continents and global summaries.

⚠️ 3. Highest Infection Rates

Identifies locations with the highest infection rates relative to their populations.

📆 4. Infection Trends Over Time

Tracks infection rate changes per location over time.

💉 5. Vaccination Progress

Joins vaccination data with case statistics to analyze the proportion of vaccinated individuals per population.

📊 6. Population vs Vaccination Analysis

Uses CTEs to calculate rolling vaccination rates and assess their impact on infection trends.

⚰️ 7. Death Rate Trends

Analyzes how death rates evolved over time and across different regions.

🛠️ Technologies Used

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or any SQL database system

Tableau (for visualization, based on the created SQL view)

📝 How to Use

Run the SQL queries in a database environment.

Use the final View (PercentPopulationVaccinated) as a source for Tableau visualizations.

Analyze insights from the queries and use visual dashboards for better representation.

🔮 Future Improvements

🚀 Enhance the project with stored procedures for automation.

🔄 Implement triggers for real-time updates.

🧠 Integrate Python for deeper statistical analysis and forecasting.
